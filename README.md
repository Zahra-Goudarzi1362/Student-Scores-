In this project I Predict the scores of student base on Hours, Practice & TeamWork of thier study Through Machine Learning model.
Data is real from a school that is clear from any noises and missing values. 
I splited data into 2 part for trainning and testing: 80~20
After evaluation of my model I get R2 Score:  0.9674009883164015 which is good. 
Then I added some new input to predict their scores.
